# Distance Travel

Simple commands to calculate distance traveled over a period of time! I made this mod because I have a giant railway network and would love to figure out how long it actually is without having to do complicated math.

Thankfully, this mod does exactly that, and in a very simple way!

# Requirements
Minecraft `>=1.21.0`

Fabric Loader `>=0.16.2`

Fabric API `>=0.102.0`


# How to use

To start, simply type /dt_start to begin your tracking session! To end your tracking session, type /dt_end! To view the stats from the last tracking session, type /dt_stats!

A tracking session tracks how far you're going from your start position (which is set by using the /dt_start command) and how long your session has lasted for!

## Config
The config is short and simple, containing two options related to tracking messages and opening stats after finishing tracking without having to use an extra command. There's also an option to change tracking intervals!
